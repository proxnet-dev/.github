Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to, well, what could could described in these three words: "Barely above adequate".
I primarily write shiz in JavaScript. Never touched TypeScript, probably never will - no drive to do so, nor because I think TS is inferior in some way. Just not used to it.

### 'What the fuck is "proxnet"?'
Short for 'the proxima network', as in Proxima Centauri - the closest star to the sun. Every homelabber has a name for their network!

I thought it would sound cool because strangers from my high school ask me sometimes for game servers, and I'm literally (probably) the closest physical option for hosting.
It is explicitly written in lowercase. *'aesthetics'*

### 'Your code isn't as shit as you think it is! How can I contribute?'
Are you a lunatic?

Reality concerning the current state of my fuck-code aside, you can fork & pull or create an issue.
